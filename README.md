# DanexLang

**DanexLang** is a clean, modern programming language designed by **Danison Nuñez**.  
It features expression-oriented syntax, implicit return semantics, and minimal boilerplate — ideal for logic-heavy applications, education, and experimentation.

## ✨ Key Features

- Expression-based method syntax with optional result variables
- Implicit return via assignment to the method name or result
- Block `{}` and arrow `=>` method forms
- `exit;` for early termination in void methods
- Designed for readability and fast prototyping
